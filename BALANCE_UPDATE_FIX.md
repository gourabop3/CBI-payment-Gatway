# Razorpay Balance Update Fix

## Problem Identified
The balance was not updating after successful Razorpay payments due to a **race condition** between the frontend payment handler and backend verification process.

### Root Cause
1. **Frontend Payment Handler**: Executed immediately when Razorpay confirmed payment
2. **Backend Verification**: Happened asynchronously via callback URL 
3. **Race Condition**: `fetchUserProfile()` was called too early (after 2 seconds), before backend verification completed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/Amount/AddAmountModel.jsx`)
- **Removed**: Arbitrary 2-second timeout approach
- **Added**: Transaction status polling mechanism
- **Improved**: Proper error handling and user feedback

#### Key Features:
- **Polling Function**: Checks transaction status every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds
- **Smart Retry**: Uses new `/amount/status/:txn_id` endpoint for reliable status checking
- **User Feedback**: Proper toast notifications for each stage of the process

### 2. Backend Changes

#### New Service Method (`backend/src/service/AmountService.js`)
```javascript
static async checkTransactionStatus(txn_id, user)
```
- Returns structured transaction status: `'completed'`, `'failed'`, or `'pending'`
- Includes proper authorization checks
- Provides detailed transaction and account information

#### New Controller Method (`backend/src/controller/AmountController.js`)
```javascript
static checkTransactionStatus = async(req,res)
```

#### New API Endpoint (`backend/src/router/amount/index.js`)
```
GET /amount/status/:txn_id
```
- Authenticated endpoint for checking transaction status
- More reliable than debug endpoints

## How It Works Now

1. **Payment Initiation**: User clicks Pay → Razorpay modal opens
2. **Payment Success**: Razorpay confirms payment → Handler starts polling
3. **Backend Processing**: Callback URL verifies payment → Updates balance in database
4. **Status Polling**: Frontend polls `/amount/status/:txn_id` every 2 seconds
5. **Balance Update**: Once status = 'completed' → `fetchUserProfile()` → Balance updated in UI

## Benefits

✅ **Eliminates Race Conditions**: Waits for actual backend verification completion
✅ **Reliable Balance Updates**: No more manual page refreshes needed
✅ **Better UX**: Clear feedback throughout the payment process  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper handling of failed payments
✅ **Scalable**: Can handle varying backend processing times

## Testing

The fix ensures:
- Balance updates automatically after successful payments
- Failed payments are properly handled
- No more "refresh the page" scenarios
- Consistent experience across different network conditions
