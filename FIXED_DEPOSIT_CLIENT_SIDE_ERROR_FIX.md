# Fixed Deposit Client-Side Error Fix

## Issue Description
The Fixed Deposit section was showing an "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" when loading the page on the Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by an import issue with the `FaTrendingUp` icon from the `react-icons/fa` package. The specific error was:

```
Attempted import error: 'FaTrendingUp' is not exported from '__barrel_optimize__?names=FaCalendarAlt,FaChartLine,FaCoins,FaPlus,FaTrendingUp!=!react-icons/fa' (imported as 'FaTrendingUp').
```

This was happening due to Next.js 15's barrel optimization feature that affects how certain icons are exported from the react-icons package.

## Files Affected
- `frontend/src/app/(root)/fd-amount/page.jsx`

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the problematic `FaTrendingUp` import from `react-icons/fa` with `MdTrendingUp` from `react-icons/md` which is properly exported and available.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Import Statement:**
   ```jsx
   // Before:
   import { FaCoins, FaPlus, FaTrendingUp, FaCalendarAlt, FaChartLine } from 'react-icons/fa'
   import { MdSavings, MdAccountBalance } from 'react-icons/md'
   
   // After:
   import { FaCoins, FaPlus, FaCalendarAlt, FaChartLine } from 'react-icons/fa'
   import { MdSavings, MdAccountBalance, MdTrendingUp } from 'react-icons/md'
   ```

2. **Updated Icon Usage:**
   - Replaced `<FaTrendingUp className="text-xl" />` with `<MdTrendingUp className="text-xl" />`
   - Replaced `<FaTrendingUp className="text-2xl text-green-600" />` with `<MdTrendingUp className="text-2xl text-green-600" />`

## Verification
- Build now completes successfully without warnings
- No more client-side exceptions on the Fixed Deposit page
- Application loads properly on Vercel deployment

## Impact
- Fixed the critical client-side exception preventing users from accessing the Fixed Deposit section
- Improved application stability and user experience
- No visual changes - the new icon (`MdTrendingUp`) provides similar visual representation

## Prevention
For future development:
1. Test icon imports thoroughly when using react-icons
2. Use Next.js development mode to catch import errors early
3. Run build process before deployment to catch compilation issues
4. Consider using individual icon imports instead of barrel exports when using Next.js 15+

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Fixed Deposit section now loads without client-side exceptions.
