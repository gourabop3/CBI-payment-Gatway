# Internal Bank Account Recharge System ✅

## Confirmed: Recharge Uses Your Bank Account, Not External Payment Services

The recharge and bill payment system is correctly configured to use your **internal bank account balance** directly, without any external payment gateways like Razorpay.

## 🏦 How It Works

### 1. Balance Verification
- System checks your current bank account balance
- Validates sufficient funds before processing
- Shows real-time balance in the UI

### 2. Direct Deduction
- Amount is **immediately deducted** from your bank account
- No external payment processing required
- Transaction happens within your banking system

### 3. Account Updates
- Your account balance updates in real-time
- Transaction history records the recharge/bill payment
- New balance is immediately available

## 💰 Transaction Flow Example

```
User Account Balance: ₹10,000

Mobile Recharge Request:
- Mobile: 9876543210
- Operator: Jio  
- Amount: ₹299

Processing:
✅ Check balance: ₹10,000 >= ₹299 ✓
✅ Deduct amount: ₹10,000 - ₹299 = ₹9,701
✅ Update account balance: ₹9,701
✅ Create transaction record: "Mobile Recharge - Jio - 9876543210"
✅ Send confirmation

Result:
New Account Balance: ₹9,701
Recharge Status: Success ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Processing
```javascript
// Get user's bank account
const user = await UserModel.findById(userId).populate('account_no');
const account = user.account_no[0]; // Primary account

// Check sufficient balance
if (account.amount < amount) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Insufficient balance for recharge");
}

// Deduct amount directly from bank account
await AccountModel.findByIdAndUpdate(
    account._id,
    { $inc: { amount: -amount } }, // Direct deduction
    { session }
);

// Create transaction record
const transaction = new TransactionModel({
    account: account._id,
    user: userId,
    amount: amount,
    type: 'debit',
    remark: `Mobile Recharge - ${operator} - ${mobileNumber}`
});
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Shows user's actual bank account balance
const userBalance = primaryAccount?.amount || 0;

// Validates recharge amount against balance
if (amount > userBalance) {
    toast.error('Insufficient balance');
    return;
}

// Sends request to internal API (not external payment gateway)
const response = await axiosClient.post('/recharge/mobile', {
    mobileNumber: mobileNumber,
    operator: operator,
    amount: amount
});
```
